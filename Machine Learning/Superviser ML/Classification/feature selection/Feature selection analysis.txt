Feature selection analysis
1) Variance threshold method
2) Mutual info classify
3) P-value
4) Forward selection and backward selection
5) Correlation with target 

============== Variance threshold method ================
1) we have  data has constant values : variance=0
   we are droping these type of columns

2) Mutaual info clasify:
    
       It will explain about the relation between input and output
       a) KNN 
       b) entropy
   
    Input vs Output
    1) Information gain : 
    2) KNN : 
    3) Rsquare and adjsuted R-square
         The exaplainability about Y based on x

3) Forward selection and backward selection
   
      Tv   Np    Sm     Sales
     sales= bo+b1*TV ========== > Rsq /adj   80
     sales = bo+b1*Tv+b2*Sm ==== >           85

     sales= bo+b1*Tv+b2*Sm+b3*Np  ==== Rsquare
     sales= bo+b1*Tv+b2*Sm

4) P-value

    Ho:  There is no realtion between X and Y
    H1:  There is a relation between  X and y
  P<0.05   you reject the null hypothesis
  which variable has  p<0.05   that variable will be included

5) Correlation:

      Will get correlation between all the variable
      we need to avoid the relation among input variables
      we need relation between input and output 





=============================================================
Step-1: Import the packages
Step-2: Read the data
Step-3: EDA

        1) Missing value analysis
                - drop
                - mean/median/mode
                - bfill
                - ffill
                - comapare two variable we can fill the values

       2) Outlier analysis:
                - Box plot How many outliers are there
                - Fill the outliers medain value
                - Fill the outliers q3 or q1
       3) Numerical data analysis: data is skewed 
          Data transformation techqniues:
               - Log transformation
               - Exponential transformation
               - Reciprocal transformation
	       - square root transformation
               - power 
       4) Bi variate analysis 
               - Understanding of more about data
               - good way to do missing values/ outliers

       5) Correlation for only numerical data

       6) Convert cat to numerical
               - maping manually
               - pd.get dummies :  One hot encoder
                     adv: variables become independent
                     dis: data becomes sparse
                          curse of dimensionality
               - LabelEncoder

       7) Standardize the data or Normalize the data  
        
       8) Feature selection (optional)
       
       9) Principle component analysis (PCA) (Optional)

Step-4: Divide the data into input and output
Step-5: Divide the data into train test split
Step-6: Develop the ML model using X_train, y_train
Step-7: Pass the X_test data to the model, y_pred
Step-8: Compare y_test with y_pred
Step-9: Evaluation Metrics
Step-10: Hyper parameter tuning
          - will change the model parameter to increase the performance
          - feature selection to increase the model performance
          - PCA 

Step-11:  Saving of the model  .pkl  and .joblib
Step-12:  Load the model and pass the test cases
Step-13:  Deploy the model/ API / Application 




In Mutual info classify ==== realtion between input output

you got array of values [v1,v2,v3,v4,......v11]

pd.Series(values)

0   v1
1   v2
2   v3

11  v11

col1  v1
col2  v2

sorted : top 5 columns

selectKBest ====== k =5  top 5 columns 



I will share one data set : EDA
ready with Numerical data
Classification model tomorrow

Till 5 steps you need to do
real time project :  Hurdles 


Churn reason            Churn status 
  service is good     He churned

Mode: service good
